# DSA Practice - Arrays and Strings

This repository contains my Java practice problems and solutions focused on **Arrays** and **Strings**, which are fundamental topics in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.

## 🚀 What’s Inside
- 🔢 Array-related problems: traversals, sorting, searching, subarrays, and more
- 🔤 String problems: manipulation, frequency count, substrings, anagrams, and pattern matching
- Solutions implemented in **Java**
- Based on popular DSA resources like:
  - [Take U Forward DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org)
  - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)

## 📁 Files
- `ArrayProblems.java` – contains various array-related problems
- `StringProblems.java` – contains string manipulation and logic-based problems

## 🧠 Learning Goals
- Strengthen logic building
- Improve problem-solving speed
- Prepare for technical interviews

## ✅ Tools Used
- VS Code
- Java (JDK 8+)
- Git & GitHub

## 📌 Notes
All problems are solved as part of my weekly learning schedule. I aim to update this repo regularly as I progress.
